# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  title: Check me out on GitHub Today 
  text: I was raised as an inventor and trained as an engineer at Cornell. I've spent most of my professional career in various consulting roles... from designing nuclear submarines and working on complex wargame style software simulations for the U.S. Navy to helping state governments and major utilities around the country leverage new technologies to save energy. For the past few years, I've been working on my personalized children's book platform, Slokie. I'm currently looking for my next big move. I've included a couple portfolio projects below. Please check them out.
# - displayed at the bottom
closing-head: Work with me
closing-para: Now that Slokie is up and running (and mostly automated), I'm starting to think about what to do with myself next. If you have an interesting project that could use my expertise, please contact me via LinkedIn, or fill out the contact form.

# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
